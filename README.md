# RoundRobinSimulator

## Overview
RoundRobinSimulator is a process scheduling simulation application designed to demonstrate the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm in a producer/consumer model. It offers an interactive graphical user interface to visualize and manipulate the scheduling process in real-time.

## Features
- Simulate the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm.
- Interactive producer and consumer process management.
- Real-time visualization of process queuing and execution.
- Log outputs for detailed process tracking.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RoundRobinSimulator.git
cd RoundRobinSimulator
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute:
```bash
python app.py
```
Interact with the GUI to add producers and consumers, and observe how the Round-Robin scheduler manages the processes.
